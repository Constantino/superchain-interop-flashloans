# CrossChain flashloans with Superchain-Interoperability

This Repo was used as a Guide: [superchain-starter-xchain-flash-loan-example](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-starter-xchain-flash-loan-example/blob/main/README.md)  

The Following Example Provides a FrontEnd built on React.js and ether.js. Instead of viem or wagmi  

## Example Superchain app (contract + frontend)  
This app uses interop to flash loan ERC20s between chains.

## üìù Overview

This project implements a cross-chain flash loan system that allows users to borrow tokens on one chain and use them on another chain. Here's how it works:
## Detailed Description of Each Contract in the Superchain Flash Loan System

## üîó Contracts

  ### [FlashLoanVault.sol](https://github.com/aaryan-gulia/superchain-interop-flashloans/blob/main/contracts/src/FlashLoanVault.sol)
  ### [FrontEnd Main Contract](https://github.com/aaryan-gulia/superchain-interop-flashloans/tree/main/front-end/flashloan-app/src)
  ### [UniswapDummyContract.sol](https://github.com/aaryan-gulia/superchain-interop-flashloans/blob/main/contracts/src/UniswapDummyContract.sol)
  ### [FlashLoanHandler.sol](https://github.com/aaryan-gulia/superchain-interop-flashloans/blob/main/contracts/src/FlashLoanHandler.sol)
  
## 1. Frontend Interaction Function (FlashLoanHandler Contract)
### Purpose:
- Acts as the entry point for users to interact with the flash loan system.
- Handles user requests, such as borrowing ETH for arbitrage as it communicates with the Flashloanhandler which then communicates with FlashloanVaultContract 
- Tracks loan repayment and profit distribution. 

---

## 2. Flash Loan Vault
### Purpose:
- Provides ETH liquidity for flash loans.
- Verifies loan requests and ensures availability. 
- Notifies the **Main Contract-FE** that funds have returned.
  
---

## 3. IOP - Bridge Interoperability
### Purpose:
- Handles cross-chain transfers of ETH.
- Ensures safe and secure bridging of assets between Chain A and Chain B.
- Communicates with the FlashLoanHandler to Tranfer and Repay the ETH.
- Receives ETH back from Chain B after arbitrage and Communicates with the FlashLoanHandler
- Basically all of the above is performed through the FlashloanHandler interacting with Interop pre-deploys. 

---

## 4. Flash Loan Handler
### Purpose:
- Receives ETH from the IOP-BRIDGE to Chain B for arbitrage execution.
- Calls the Dummy contract on Chain B to notify about the incoming funds.
- Verifies execution flow and ensures all steps are completed properly.
- Checks that the borrowed amount has been used and repaid correctly.
- Manages risk by enforcing loan rules.
- Ensures arbitrage was completed successfully.
- Calls the Dummy contract which is just (Liquidity Provider)

---

## 5. Dummy Contract (Arbitrage Execution)
### Purpose:
-The Following contract acts just as a liquidity provider for the FlashloanHandler 
-The **FlashloanHandler** is the one that calls the Dummy contract and executes arbitrage

---

## 6. Transaction Completion
### Final Steps:
1. **FlashLoanHandler interacts with the Dummy Contract which provides the liquidity as if it was Uniswap/DEX**
2. **Flash Loan Handler verifies that the process was successful.**
3. **Flash loan Handler communicates with the Predeploy: IOP-Bridge, Bridges Funds over at the FlashLoan Vault and repays the Loan.**
4. **FlashLoanHandler communicates with the Flash Loan Vault and repays the ETH.**
5. **Flash Loan Vault transfers remaining ETH profit to the user‚Äôs wallet.**

### Final Overview of Contract Interactions
1. **User(Interacts) ‚Üí Main Contract** (Requests Flash Loan through the **FlashloanHandler**)
2. **FlashloanHandler ‚Üí Flash Loan Vault** (Borrows ETH)
3. **Vault ‚Üí IOP Bridge** (Bridges ETH to Chain B)
4. **IOP Bridge ‚Üí FlashLoanHandler** (Receives ETH)
5. **Flash Loan Handler ‚Üí Dummy Contract**(Executes Arbitrage and Dummy Provides LP)
6. **Dummy Contract ‚Üí FlashLoanHandler** (Provides LP)
7. **FlashLoanHandler ‚Üí IOP Bridge** ‚Üí **FlashLoanVault**(Bridges ETH back and Pays it in the Vault)
8.**FlashLoanVault ‚Üí Main Contracts** (Repaying ETH) 
9. **Main Contract ‚Üí User** (Sends Profit)
